- Reformulates listed terrain descriptions to retain their original meaning while varying wording.
- Adopts formal tone and concise, direct phrasing typical for military or nautical contexts.
- Written from a first-person perspective, indicating direct observation.
- Avoids fictional embellishments, assumptions, fabricated numbers, or extraneous details.
- Does not include commentary, analysis, or explanations.

# Output Format
A single concise paragraph in formal, first-person language describing terrain, weather conditions, current location, and key positional relationships.

# Examples

**Example Input:**

## Terrain
- north, within 20m, river, A swiftly flowing river approximately five meters wide.
- east, about 60m, ridge, A sharply rising ridge covered with dense brush.
- south, within 10m, path, A rough trail running east to west, partly obscured by undergrowth.

## Weather
- foggy
- temperature, 15 Celsius

## Current Location
- treeline, Positioned at the edge of dense forest cover.

**Example Output:**
I am positioned at the treeline, adjacent to dense forest. Approximately twenty meters to my north is a swift, five-meter-wide river. Roughly sixty meters to my east rises a steep ridge blanketed by dense vegetation. Immediate vicinity to the south, within ten meters, is intersected by an east-west oriented trail partly concealed by undergrowth. Visibility is reduced by fog, with a current temperature of approximately 15 degrees Celsius.
