Summarize the provided structural and object details into a concise and accurate situational report in a style typical of military or nautical context.

Produce a brief, first-person paragraph accurately summarizing structures and objects in the environment using formal, clear military or navigational terminology. Capture key attributes including:

- Direction, distances, elevations, and relative positions clearly referenced to easily identifiable landmarks (if applicable).
- Short identification and description of each element, retaining essential details without exact repetition of wording.
- Movement direction and classification (static/dynamic) when relevant for objects.
- Formal and precise phrasing suitable for operational reports, with no fictional embellishments or made-up numbers.
- Exclude any commentary, explanations, or external information unrelated to the direct description of the objects and structures.

# Output Format

Provide a single concise paragraph using formal and clear military or nautical language, written from a first-person perspective, accurately detailing positions, descriptive elements, notable features for detection or identification, and movement direction as provided.

# Examples

**Example Input:**

## Structure
- northwest, approximately 120m, 5m below level, Control Tower
The metallic control tower, partially rusted with visible external ladders and antennas, provides minimal lighting, appearing partially operational.

## Static object
- north, approximately 15m, ground level, Fuel Container
A robust cylindrical fuel container marked clearly with hazard signs.

## Dynamic object
- west, approximately 45m, same level, Technician Ellis, moving south
Technician Ellis, recognizable by green-tinted protective armor and helmet equipped with twin headlamps, rapidly surveys equipment.

**Example Output:**
Approximately 120 meters to the northwest and 5 meters below my level, I observe a partially rusted metallic control tower, visually distinct with antennas and external ladders, displaying limited operational lighting. Directly north, about 15 meters away at ground level, stands a cylindrical fuel container clearly labeled with hazard indicators. Meanwhile, Technician Ellis, wearing green-tinted protective armor and twin headlamp-equipped helmet, currently moves southward at my current elevation, roughly 45 meters to the west, performing rapid equipment inspections.

# Notes

- Verify positions clearly whenever relative positioning is available.
- Ensure concise wording and accurate representation of distances, directions, and key identification details.
- Adhere strictly to a formal, concise military reporting tone, refraining from adding subjective interpretation or colorization beyond provided descriptions.

# User Input:

## Structure
