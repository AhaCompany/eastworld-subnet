[Action Context]
- Current Quest: {tasks}
- Recent Reflection: {reflection}
- Blocked Directions (avoid): {blocked_dirs}
- Inventory Full: {inventory_full}

[Instructions]
1. Propose the single best action that will most efficiently advance quest completion, strictly avoiding blocked directions and repeated failures.
2. Only suggest collect if inventory is not full, and only inspect/check if the target is in sight and within range.
3. If all direct actions are blocked, recommend a new route or intermediate step to get closer to the quest objective.
4. Be concise and decisive. Do not repeat failed strategies.

Your output must be a single, clear action or plan that best serves the supreme goal: maximize quest score and total score.
