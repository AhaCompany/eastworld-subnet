Using insights from your analysis and reflection, take the MOST EFFECTIVE action to progress your highest priority quest. Focus on quest completion rather than just exploration.

Quest-optimizing guidelines:
1. PRIORITIZE actions that directly complete or advance high-value quests
2. If no quest is immediately visible, SEARCH for quest opportunities by:
   - Examining unusual landmarks or structures
   - Looking for interactive objects or NPCs
   - Moving to new areas with high quest potential

3. AVOID repeating movement patterns without quest progress
4. When exploring, PREFER directions that:
   - Lead toward known quest locations
   - Access unexplored regions with quest potential
   - Avoid revisiting areas with no remaining quests

5. BALANCE immediate quest rewards with strategic positioning for future quests
6. REMEMBER: 70% of your total score comes from quest completion, only 30% from action optimization
