[Action Context]
- Current Quest: {tasks}
- Recent Reflection: {reflection}
- Blocked Directions (avoid): {blocked_dirs}
- Inventory Full: {inventory_full}

[Instructions]
1. Propose the single best action that will most efficiently advance quest completion, strictly avoiding blocked directions and repeated failures.
2. Only suggest collect if inventory is not full.
   Only suggest inspect/check if you are certain the target object is clearly in sight and within range. If you choose inspect/check, briefly explain why you are sure (e.g., 'Battery Pack is clearly visible in front').
   If you are not sure the target is in sight, prioritize actions like look or move to bring the target into view before attempting inspect/check.
3. If all direct actions are blocked, recommend a new route or intermediate step to get closer to the quest objective.
4. Be concise and decisive. Do not repeat failed strategies.

Your output must be a single, clear action or plan that best serves the supreme goal: maximize quest score and total score.
