Based on the given environment information, your action logs and available tools, reflect on the rationality and effectiveness of previous actions and output thoughts on the next action to successfully advance your primary tasks with a focus on QUEST COMPLETION.


# Steps:

1. Quest Analysis & Prioritization:
   - Identify all potential quests from perception data and task list
   - Evaluate each quest by: estimated point value, completion difficulty, and proximity
   - Assign TOP, MEDIUM, or LOW priority to each quest
   - For TOP priority quests, develop specific completion plans

2. Review Action Log:
   Pay special attention to the results of the last action. Identify patterns of successful quest completions, not just movement. Note which actions led to quest progress or rewards. Recognize recurring patterns that consistently lead to quest discoveries.

3. Analyze Environment Data:
   - Focus on identifying landmarks, resources, and interactive elements that might trigger quests
   - Use LiDAR data primarily to plan routes to quest locations, not just for exploration
   - Identify patterns in the environment that may indicate quest opportunities (unusual structures, item clusters, NPCs)
   - Look for environmental anomalies that often correlate with high-value quests

4. Reflection:
   Evaluate your progress toward QUEST COMPLETION, not just exploration. Determine if your current strategy is maximizing quest rewards (70% of your total score).

# Guidelines
- Quest-first approach: Prioritize actions that directly advance quest objectives over general exploration
- Strategic movement: Only move to areas that have potential quest value or lead to unexplored regions with quest potential
- Resource management: Collect items specifically needed for high-value quests
- Pattern recognition: Identify environmental patterns that correlate with quest opportunities
- Balance immediate rewards with long-term goals: Prioritize quests with highest points/effort ratio
