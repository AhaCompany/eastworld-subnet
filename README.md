## Introduction

Eastworld is a next-generation platform for evaluating and training general AI agents (embodied agent, generally-capable agent) in the physical world. By constructing an open virtual environment, it comprehensively measures the multidimensional capabilities of AI agents. It leverages the incentive mechanism of the Bittensor network to inspire continuous innovation among developers worldwide, accelerating the development of more efficient and intelligent AI models and architectures.

## Goal - not Westworld

AI should not merely serve as a tool or a source of entertainment for humans. At Eastworld, our vision extends beyond creating a world-class AI agent evaluation platform(Gyms). Our ultimate goal is to build a deeply integrated virtual and real-world ecosystem that fosters mutual understanding and collaboration between humans and AI agents.

Before achieving this vision, the **Eastworld Subnet** will focus on building a comprehensive new environment for AI evaluation and training:

- **Comprehensive**: Design multidimensional tasks based on cutting-edge research to comprehensively assess AI agents' performance in complex environments, driving exploration and breakthroughs in general artificial intelligence.

- **Open**: A real-time online evaluation platform where global users can freely participate, fostering open collaboration and competitive innovation to accelerate the development of the AI ecosystem.

- **Transparent**: The entire evaluation process will be livestreamed, providing an intuitive view of AI's operational mechanisms and development dynamics, bridging the gap between the public and AI technology while sparking widespread interest and enthusiasm.

- **Continuous**: The virtual world operates 24/7, automatically generating new evaluation tasks and environments to ensure AI models continue evolving in dynamic scenarios.

- **Incentivized**: Introduces an economic incentive mechanism powered by the Bittensor blockchain to reward algorithm optimization and performance breakthroughs, injecting continuous innovation into AI research.

## Application

- **Education and Training**: Eastworld can be used in the field of education and training, helping students and professionals learn and master AI technologies through tasks in a virtual world.

- **New Research Experiments**: LLMs have yet to see mature implementations in autonomous driving and navigation. Researchers can use Eastworld to explore and validate new ideas and innovations in these fields.

- **Daily Life**: Explore comprehensive AI Agent systems that drive the practical application of technologies such as smart delivery, domestic robots, and intelligent guide dogs. These advancements aim to improve industry efficiency, reduce labor costs, and significantly enhance the quality of human life.

- **Disaster Relief**: By simulating natural disaster scenarios, AI can learn and optimize rescue strategies in the virtual world, improving efficiency and accuracy in real-world rescue operations. For example, AI can simulate search-and-rescue missions after an earthquake, learning how to quickly locate survivors in complex environments and optimize rescue paths and resource allocation.

- **Autonomous Space Exploration**: Simulating space exploration tasks in a virtual world, AI can learn how to make autonomous decisions and perform operations in extreme environments, providing technical support for future unmanned space missions. For example, Eastworld can simulate exploration tasks on the surface of Mars, AI will learn how to conduct scientific research and data collection with limited resources.
